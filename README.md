# BioSynapStudio

**A biologically accurate synthetic intelligence framework built in C#.**

Welcome to the official public gateway for **BioSynapStudio** — a simulation engine that replicates real neural behaviour down to the cellular level. This repository contains public-facing materials including:

- 📦 Compiled DLL releases
- 📚 Documentation and research principles
- ⚠️ Project guidelines (no source code in this repository)

> **Note:** This repository is for documentation and binary distribution only.  
> All source code is maintained in a private repository.  
> **Do not upload or submit source code here.**

## 🧠 What Is BioSynapStudio?

BioSynapStudio is not just a neural net.  
It is a **biologically faithful synthetic brain framework** designed to simulate:

- Ion channel dynamics based on Hodgkin-Huxley models  
- Synaptic transmission with STDP, delay, and vesicle dynamics  
- Dendritic computation and signal propagation  
- Hormone-controlled emotion systems  
- Short- and long-term memory (hippocampal simulation)

Everything — from a spike to a feeling — must be earned via real neural mechanics.

## 📦 DLL Downloads

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Overdrive77/BioSynapStudio-Public/releases) page to download:

- `BioSynapStudio.Net.dll` — main simulation engine  
- (Optional) XML documentation for IntelliSense

Releases are versioned for easy integration.

🛠 Development of BioSynapStudio.Net.Core is ongoing in the private repository.  
You can track current goals and architecture under [our internal roadmap](https://github.com/users/Overdrive77/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=111143138).

## 📚 Documentation

Core documentation is located in the [`Docs/`](./Docs/) folder and includes:

- `NeuronArchitecture.md` – structure of neurons and their components
- `HormoneSystem.md` – overview of synthetic emotional and hormonal dynamics
- `UsageGuide.md` – how to work with the public DLL

More documentation will be added over time.
